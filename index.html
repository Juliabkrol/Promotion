        <h2>About The Artist</h2>
        <p>Llew Mejia is a stylistic illustrator skilled in hand-drawn illustration, pattern/print, packaging, branding, and computer generated illustration.

          In his younger years, his family traveled back and forth between Mexico and the Southwestern United States. As a result he is bilingual and has a unique perspective on American as well as Mexican culture.
          
          Llew enjoys working on patterns for print, lettering, painting, buying folk art, watering his plants, and perusing through old occult books.</p>
